Two Pointer:
find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints

1. find a pair in the array in sorted array
2. Avg time complexity n-n*k
3. best is n


patterns : 
	pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target. not contiguous -O(n) -take left=0,right=length-1 
	Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates -- two pointer --as first is starting assigned to next not same number 
	sorted array squares of all the number of the input array --take left right, compare and put max to last
	triplets,Quadruple in it that add up to zero/close to target/smaller -- non contiguous --left right from index i o(n2)
	sub array product less than target --two pointer and sliding window-- moving to next divide as product
	sort 0,1 2 -- 0 comes first, 2 comes last intermediate is 1 O(n)
	comparing two string -- top1, top 2
