Sliding windows:

1. use this for all array/list questions with contiguos elements in the data set.
2. Avg time complexity n-n*k
3. best is n


Two patterns : with boundary and without

1. with boundary :

        step 1: u have given 'k'
        step 2: slide the ranges with respect to fixed size 'k';

        ex: Average contiguous sum

2. without boundary:

        step 1: no fixed length
        step 2: adjust and shrink the slider to get solution


        ex: smallest sub array
