Pattern Tree Breadth First Search:


traversal of a tree in a level-by-level, will use a Queue to keep track of all the nodes

populate the values of all nodes of each level from left to right 
	use queue level wise	, arraylist, linkedlist
connect each node with its level order successor.The last node of each level should point to the first node
of the next level.
previousNode, currentNode, 

nodes visible when the tree is seen from the right side.
	
	
	O(N)---time and space complexity
